<p>Sub-landing page types provide an overview of a topic and/or group of related content. As with the landing page type, the focus of these pages is enabling users to quickly skim content options and select the category that interests them or meets their need. The sub-landing page template should always be used as a child page to the Landing page template.</p>

<p>Each sub-landing page template has three basic content areas with two variations in layout:</p>

<nomarkdown>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/static/img/sublanding_examples.png" alt="landing examples" height="100%" width="100%">
</nomarkdown>

<h2 id="use">Use case</h2>

<div class="content-67 content-first">

#### When to use
* When creating a new topic area within one of the main navigation verticals. 
* Target user is primarily in an explore mindset, so the main content of this page should be focused on introducing them to the topic and directing them to the specific content that will meet their needs.

#### When other options are better
* When page content includes multiple paragraphs of copy or more detailed definitions or explanations.
* When the desired user interaction is more geared toward encouraging users to sit down and read something or engage deeply with an interactive tool.
