<p>Sub-landing page types provide an overview of a topic and/or group of related content. As with the landing page type, the focus of these pages is enabling users to quickly skim content options and select the category that interests them or meets their need. The sub-landing page template should always be used as a child page to the Landing page template.</p>

<p>Each sub-landing page template has three basic content areas with two variations in layout:</p>

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/static/img/sublanding_examples.png" alt="landing examples" height="100%" width="100%">
</nomarkdown>

<h2 id="use">Use case</h2>

<div class="content-67 content-first">

#### When to use
* When creating a new topic area within one of the main navigation verticals. 
* Target user is primarily in an explore mindset, so the main content of this page should be focused on introducing them to the topic and directing them to the specific content that will meet their needs.

#### When other options are better
* When page content includes multiple paragraphs of copy or more detailed definitions or explanations.
* When the desired user interaction is more geared toward encouraging users to sit down and read something or engage deeply with an interactive tool.

<h2 id="content-guidelines">Content Guidelines</h2>

* Page titles are sentence case and use the word “and” instead of “&”.
* The content components should work together to create an overview of the information held within the section and how it relates back to the main navigation section. 
* Should be written and organized in a way that aids the user in skimming and quickly navigating to lower-level pages where they’ll find the information they need.
* Components should work together to give users clear next steps and calls to actions; give them the opportunity to decide quickly what content is relevant to them and where they should go next.
* While full width body copy (including bulleted lists) is an option in this template, it should be used sparingly. 

<h2 id="style">Style</h2>

#### Area 1: Introduction
* Choose between a hero or text introduction for this area.
* Option for using breakout sidebar variation of the text introduction. 

#### Area 2: Main content
* Must contain at least 1 component.
* Recommended hierarchy of components:  featured content module, [image & text]() components, [gray well](), and [half width link blobs](), [full width text](), contact information.
* [Gray well]() component should not be used at the top of this area if the introduction area contains a hero. 

#### Area 3: Sidebar
* Must contain at least 1 component.
* If using both static and dynamic content, preference for dynamic content to 
appear above static content.
