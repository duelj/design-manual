<p>Learn page types provide focused, detailed information about a specific topic to users. These pages may contain lengthy text passages or interactive content that requires more engagement from the user.</p>
<p>Each learn page template has three basic content areas:</p>

<p>Engage and understand. Provide specific, detailed, focused information to user. This should be for the most engaged users -- ones willing to read a bit more or looking for specific information. Use for individual blog posts, speeches, press releases etc, as well as explanations of a topic. These pages will be how most new information and content is published; other higher-level page templates are mostly aimed at navigating users to the right Learn page. The related content sidebar provides users horizontal navigation options so these pages don't feel like a dead end.</p>
