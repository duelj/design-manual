<div class="content-67 content-first">
<p>Landing pages provide an overview of a section and help users situate themselves within the site and the subject matter. Users should be able to quickly skim section topics and select the category that interests them.</p>

#### When to use
* The landing page template should be used for the top level page under each main navigation section on the site to help users navigate to the various sub-sections within the navigation vertical.  
* This template may also be used for campaign pages.

#### When to use something else
* When a new page is needed within a navigation section, rather than at the top level.
* When page  content includes paragraph copy or more detailed deifnitions or explanations.

#### Top of the page (1a or 1b)
* Template requires one of two options for the top of the page: either a hero (1a) or using a text introduction (1b). With a [text introduction](), the sidebar takes the full length of the page. 

#### Main content area (2)
* This area must contain at least one page component, but we have no default preference as to which one(s). 
* Recommended hierarchy of components from top of the page down, is [image & text]() components, [gray well](), and [half width link blobs](). 
* [Gray well]() component should not be used as the top item within this area of the page, if the top of the page contains a hero.

#### Sidebar (3)
* This area must contain at least one page component, but we have no default preference as to which one(s). 
* If using both static and dynamic content, preference for dynamic content to appear first.



<h2 id="content-guidelines">Content Guidelines</h2>

* Headings should be as succinct as possible, ideally ______ characters  or less.
* Description beneath heading should also be succint, roughly ______ characters.
* Call to action link should  ______ characters or less.
* Full width body copy is not an option in this template as content should be focused on skimming and navigating.
