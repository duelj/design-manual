Atomic design is methodology created by [Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/) for creating modular design systems. There are five distinct levels in atomic design (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages) that create a hierarchy from details to full page styles.

<p>These priciplas were lifted from Brad Frostâ€™s book on atomic design. For more information see his [GitHub repository]().</p>

* They **promote consistency** and cohesion across the entire experience.
* They **speed up your team's workflow**, saving time and money.
* They establish a **more collaborative workflow** between all disciplines involved in a project.
* They establish a **shared vocabulary** between everyone in an organization, including outside vendors.
* They provide **helpful documentation to help educate** stakeholders, colleagues, and even third parties.
* They **make cross-browser/device, performance, and accessibility testing easier**.
* They serve as a **future-friendly foundation** for teams to modify, extend, and improve upon over time.

### When to use
Consumerfinance.gov is built using atomic design elements, which are integrated into both the front end as well as the CMS. If the project is going to live on consumerfinance.gov atomic design elements should be used as the foundation to build from. This promotes consistency and speeds up the workflow when building new pages.


### When to use something else
* If the project is internal facing or must be tied to an existing thrid-party technology
* If the project is a mini-site that exists outside of consumerfinance.gov

<div class="content-33 content-first">
#### Atoms
<p>Atoms are the smallest and most basic building blocks of our web interfaces. Atoms could be text headings, a form label, an input or a button. These small blocks are combined to make molecules which serve as larger functional components on a page.</p>

</div>

<div class="content-33 content-first">
#### Molecules
<p>Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound. These molecules take on their own properties and serve as the backbone of our design systems.</p>

</div>

<div class="content-33 content-first">
#### Organisms
<p>Organisms are groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface. Organisms may be the repetition of one molecule type repeated, or a collection of unique molecules.</p>

</div>

<div class="content-33 content-first">
#### Templates
<p>Templates are the largest of atomic elements comprised of groups of molecules and organisms stitched together to form full page compositions. Templates reinforce the larger information architecture of cf.gov, and provide a consistent foundation for how content is laid out on a page. Templates make use of certain organisms and molecules to serve specific needs.</p>
