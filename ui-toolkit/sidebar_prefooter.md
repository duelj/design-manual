<p>These are the various sidebar elements which can be used to highlight secondary content that is related to the main page content. They can contain calls to action, blog posts, email sign ups, contact information, etc.
The pre-footer is an alternate format to accomodate different page templates and responsive screen widths. Templates that have secondary navigation can have pre-footers since there is not enough space for a sidebar. </p>

<p>Layout variations as seen in sidebar format at the 901px and larger breakpoints.</p>
