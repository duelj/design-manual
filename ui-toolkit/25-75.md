<div class="content-67 content-first">


#### When to use

When content leads to deeper page in the content section and needs a visual highlight on the page. Can be used for even or odd groupings, and imply process hierarchy with their list style view.

#### When other options are better

* When content doesnâ€™t require imagery. Suggest using the [Half-width Link Blob]() pattern instead.
* When there are multiple paragraphs of copy try [ful width text]() component.

* Any heading size can me used with this molecule, however, H2-6 are recommended as display and H1 will compete with page titles, intro section, hero, etc.

* Imagery can consist of illustration, isocon, or photography however the 1:1 ratio should be maintained for each. 

* Circle illustration 901+ viewport = 150px; 900 or less viewport = 130px

* Imagery always has 30px of padding across responsive sizes
