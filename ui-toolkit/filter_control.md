<div class="content-67 content-first">
<p>Controls that allow users to whittle down number of items in a list, housed in an expandable above the list. Use filters in conjunction with search to help users narrow down large amounts of data or content.</p>

#### When to use
* Presenting large amounts of data or content (more than 10 pages of whatever items?)
* Data has relevant characteristics to filter on, for example product and issue for complaint data, location and property type for HMDA, date range and categories for articles
* Users interacting with the content will be interested in more structure than keyword search alone can offer, and more options than a simple list of categories or tags

#### When to use something else
* The total amount of content can be paged through relatively quickly
* Search alone is sufficient for user needs
* Characteristics of the data available as filter categories are not relevant to user needs
