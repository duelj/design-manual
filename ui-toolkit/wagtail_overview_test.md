<p>The modular design of the Wagtail content management system and the use of the page templates that 

have been developed are intended to keep the redesigned page types of consumerfinance.gov 

consistent and unified. Doing so will help reinforce our authority and trustworthiness among users who 

come to our site for unbiased, clear information. As we introduce ourselves to consumers and help to 

build a brand identity, maintaining content that is clear, consistent, and readable is important, as it 

builds confidence that we are diligent about ensuring that the content we publish is accurate and that 

we present that information in a way that users can come to expect and trust.</p>


<p>This document contains a general overview of how to publish content in Wagtail and how to utilize its 

features to best present content for our users. There are more involved instructions for each page type 

in order to maintain consistency of formatting among those pages.</p>
