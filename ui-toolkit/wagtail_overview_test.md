<p>The modular design of the Wagtail content management system and the use of the page templates that 

have been developed are intended to keep the redesigned page types of consumerfinance.gov 

consistent and unified. Doing so will help reinforce our authority and trustworthiness among users who 

come to our site for unbiased, clear information. As we introduce ourselves to consumers and help to 

build a brand identity, maintaining content that is clear, consistent, and readable is important, as it 

builds confidence that we are diligent about ensuring that the content we publish is accurate and that 

we present that information in a way that users can come to expect and trust.</p>


<p>This document contains a general overview of how to publish content in Wagtail and how to utilize its 

features to best present content for our users. There are more involved instructions for each page type 

in order to maintain consistency of formatting among those pages.</p>

<div class="content-67 content-first">
 
<p>The website redesign used an “atomic” design scheme (see Design Manual). Page templates were

developed for each level of content, and each of those pages consist of modules that can be pulled 

together to build the page.</p>
</div>

<div class="content-33 content-last">

##### Page templates

[Landing page]()

[Sub landing page]()

</div>

<h2 id="wagtail_structure">Wagtail structure</h2>

<p>Wagtail navigational structure follows closely the site navigation: Start at CFGov, which holds editable 

homepage content, and follow the “>” arrows through each section down to the most specific pages, 

Document Detail pages.</p>


<p>Each page type has a corresponding template; to add a new page, click “+ Add child page” underneath 

the page it will be linked from and choose the correct page template for that child page (see site map for 

correct templates at each level).</p>


<h2 id="entering_content">Entering content on a page</h2>

<p>There are specific directions for content entry per page type based on content needs, but these 

directions will orient you to how to use the modules more generally.</p> 


### Pages consist of four main parts

* Title (Public title of page)

* Header (headline of page; includes some metadata)

* Content (main body of page)

* Sidebar (related content)

### Modules can be added to each of these fields by using the “+” sign. 

### Define each type of module

### Moving modules
<p>Adding modules within larger fields (all related metadata pieces within same Related Metadata module, not a different one each time).</p>

### Difference between “+” signs. 

### Uploading documents and images; linking pdfs

### Relative links/using Wagtail explorer to link internally. 
<p>When adding an external link to text, make sure to type the url text into the text field; if the text is pasted in it won’t link properly.</p>

<p>In bottom tool bar, select “Share on content” (select “save draft” anytime to save your work; cannot save or preview if any required fields are missing).</p>

<p>To generate a link to view the content on the Content server that can be shared with stakeholders, click “draft” next to status in upper right-hand corner of the page in blue toolbar.</p>

<p>In Full width text content module, there will be space above where the text starts, that won’t affect how it looks on the page, but do make sure that there are no extra spaces above the pasted content. Copying text over from a word document may also bring styling with it; ensure that spacing of paragraphs is correct: should only be one “enter” between paragraphs, not an extra space between them. Formatting should always be added using the toolbar at the top of the text field (bullets, sizing, numbering) and not copied over from Word documents.</p>

<p>Legacy templates should not be used for new posts; they were used specifically to migrate content from Wordpress.</p>
